# bat

Basic, awesome TAB plugin.

## Installation

#### Requirements

- Java 16+
- The latest **development** version of Velocity *(This plugin does not work on the Stable version!)*
- Git (This is only required if you intend on cloning the repository through your Terminal)

#### Compilation

- Clone this repository to a directory of your choice through running `git clone https://github.com/NearVanilla/bat.git` in your terminal. Alternatively, you can download this repository as a ZIP at the top of this page.
- Change your directory to the `bat` folder through running `cd bat`
- Run `gradlew build` to compile the project *(Ensure you have the correct version of Java)*.
- Navigate to the `libs` folder inside of the newly created `build` folder in your File Explorer.
- Drag the `bat-velocity.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your Velocity Server.
- If you do not have a `plugins/bat` folder, then start your Velocity server to generate the default configuration.
- Configure `bat` to your liking!


## Placeholders

By default, bat provides a set of placeholders using [MiniMessage's template system](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage#template).

`<date>`, `<time>`, and `<datetime>` are parsed using Java's [SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html), meaning that the players will be seeing the server's local time, not their own local time.
